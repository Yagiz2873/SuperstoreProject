# FinalProject
This is our first presentation file as Data Harmony. You can see our team, business objectives, data understanding about Superstore dataset and target analytical solutions. I'd like to thank Sine Gökhan for preparing excellent Canva and Power BI files for our project, İrfan Mızrakcı for implementing Appriori Algorithms to perform Market Basket Analysis, Arda Kantık and our teaching assistant Fatmanur Özmen for their general help. I couldn't upload our first presentation as Canva and final presentation as PowerBI file because of their size but I can show them to you throughout the interview. In our superstore dataset, there were not any null values. So, in data preparation process we've handled outliers and transformed values in the columns only.
